# Duolingo Fluency HTML Page with Google chart

An HTML page that embeds a Google Chart made from a Google Spreadsheet that tracks my Duolingo Fluency score.

Duolingo is a language learning tool that periodically will award students with a fluency estimate of their progress.

I created this page because I like Duolingo and I like Data. **Â¡Me gustan ambos!**

## Create a Spreadsheet on Google Drive

This will be a simple 2 column spreadsheet.

1.  Date
1.  Fluency Percent

## Create a Google Line Chart

Make the x-Axis Fluency Percentage and the y-Axis date. Once you have your chart pretty, select Publish Chart from the upper right corner of the chart you built.

Look for the embed code. Copy that HTML (it will be inside an iframe) and head over to the next step.

## Create an HTML page

Paste the iframe into the body of the html page. Now you can add additional text or styling. I used the style sheet from [siimple](https://siimple.juanes.xyz/) (not a misspelling).

## No more Fluency Percentages

Duolingo stopped giving users a fluency estmate in April 2018. So this project is now one for the archives.
